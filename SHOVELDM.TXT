Misc. Author Info       : The Shovelware Society defend the sacred art of
                          creating 1990s-style maps.

Description             : Shovelware deathmatch levels are a nice novelty,
                          but now you've got a bunch of "ye olde 1996"
                          quality maps that are nostalgic, fun, and tested by
                          the Shovelware Society. They're also
                          vanilla-compatible and sometimes push the
                          boundaries of visplane magic. In certain source
                          ports, there are maps with lightning effects if
                          you're into that.
